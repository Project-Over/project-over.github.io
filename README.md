This is a preview for the release of Project: Over

Project: Over is the working title for an ambitious new Solana based initiative.

The contract protections built in also assist us in building trust and interest.
The introduction of the project in this manner allows us to integrate early token holders into future programs and acquire the much needed block space for this project.
Furthermore, a Raydium listing will facilitate the proper allocation of liquidity and pave the way for the future of the project.


The dev wallet address for this project is:
